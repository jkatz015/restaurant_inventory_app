  - Saves to `data/recipes.json` (same format as Recipe Builder)
  - Converts Claude's oz measurements to your product units (lb, gallon, etc.)
  - Fuzzy matches AI ingredient names to your product names

### 2. **Updated Dependencies**

- **File**: `requirements.txt`
- **Added**:
  - `anthropic>=0.39.0` (Claude API client)
  - `rapidfuzz>=3.0.0` (fuzzy ingredient matching)

### 3. **Created Test Suite**

- **File**: `tests/test_ai_recipe_generator.py`
- **Coverage**:
  - Unit conversion tests (oz → lb, gallon, quart, etc.)
  - Fuzzy ingredient matching
  - Recipe format conversion
  - Unmapped ingredient handling

### 4. **Documentation**

Created comprehensive documentation:

- `AI_RECIPE_GENERATOR_GUIDE.md` - Complete user guide (35+ sections)
- `setup_api_key.md` - API key setup for all platforms
- Updated `README.md` - Added AI features to main docs
- `INTEGRATION_SUMMARY.md` - This file

## 🔧 How Integration Works

### Schema Compatibility

**Claude Output** → **Conversion** → **Your App Format**

```
Claude says:
{
  "recipe_name": "Grilled Chicken",
  "ingredients": [
    {"ingredient_name": "chicken breast", "oz": 48}
  ],
  "directions": ["Step 1", "Step 2"]
}

↓ Conversion Process ↓

1. Fuzzy match "chicken breast" → "Chicken Breast" (from product_data.csv)
2. Check product unit: "lb"
3. Convert 48 oz → 3 lb
4. Format as app expects:

{
  "name": "Grilled Chicken",
  "ingredients": [
    {"product_name": "Chicken Breast", "quantity": 3.0, "unit": "lb"}
  ],
  "instructions": "Step 1\nStep 2"
}

↓ Save via existing function ↓

recipe_engine.save_recipe(recipe)
  → Calculates costs using product prices
  → Saves to data/recipes.json
  → Same format as Recipe Builder
```

### Data Flow

```
User Prompt
    ↓
Claude API (generates JSON with oz)
    ↓
map_ingredient_to_product() → Fuzzy match to product_data.csv
    ↓
oz_to_unit() → Convert to product's native unit
    ↓
convert_ai_recipe_to_app_format() → Reformat to app schema
    ↓
User edits in Streamlit UI (optional)
    ↓
recipe_engine.save_recipe() → EXISTING function
    ↓
data/recipes.json → EXISTING file
    ↓
Appears in Recipe Builder, Variance Calc, etc.
```

## 🚀 Next Steps to Use

### 1. Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

This installs:

- `anthropic` - Claude API
- `rapidfuzz` - Fuzzy matching

### 2. Set API Key

**Windows PowerShell:**
```powershell
$env:ANTHROPIC_API_KEY='sk-ant-your-key-here'
```

**Mac/Linux:**
```bash
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY='sk-ant-your-key-here'
```

Get your key at: https://console.anthropic.com/settings/keys

See `setup_api_key.md` for detailed platform-specific instructions.

### 3. Run the App

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

### 4. Test the Feature

1. Navigate to "AI Recipe Generator" in sidebar
2. Should see "✅ Claude API connected"
3. Enter a recipe prompt
4. Click "Generate Recipe with AI"
5. Review ingredient mappings
6. Edit if needed
7. Save to database

## 🔍 Integration Points

### Uses Existing Code

| Function | From | Purpose |
|----------|------|---------|
| `load_products()` | `modules/recipe_engine.py` | Load product database |
| `save_recipe()` | `modules/recipe_engine.py` | Save recipe to JSON |
| `calculate_recipe_cost()` | `modules/recipe_engine.py` | Auto-calculate costs |
| `format_currency()` | `utils/shared_functions.py` | Format prices |

### Reads Existing Data

| File | Usage |
|------|-------|
| `data/product_data.csv` | Source for ingredient mapping |
| `data/recipes.json` | Save destination (same as Recipe Builder) |

### Compatible With

| Page | How It Works |
|------|--------------|
| **Recipe Builder** | AI recipes appear alongside manual recipes |
| **Variance Calculator** | AI recipes included in calculations |
| **Inventory Summary** | Costs calculated same way |

## 🎯 Key Integration Features

### 1. Fuzzy Ingredient Matching

```python
# AI says: "chicken breast"
# Database has: "Chicken Breast"
# Match score: 100% ✅

# AI says: "olive oil"
# Database has: "Olive Oil Extra Virgin"
# Match score: 85% ✅
```

### 2. Smart Unit Conversion

```python
# Product database says: Chicken Breast is sold by "lb"
# Claude says: 48 oz
# Result: 3.0 lb ✅

# Product database says: Olive Oil sold by "gallon"
# Claude says: 16 oz
# Result: 0.125 gallon ✅
```

### 3. Cost Integration

```python
# Uses existing calculate_recipe_cost() function
# Reads Cost per Oz from product_data.csv
# Same pricing as Recipe Builder
```

---

## 🧪 Testing

### Run Unit Tests

```bash
# All tests
pytest tests/test_ai_recipe_generator.py -v

# Specific test class
pytest tests/test_ai_recipe_generator.py::TestUnitConversions -v
```

## 🎨 UI Features

### Mapping Visualization

Shows:

- ✅ Mapped count
- ⚠️ Unmapped count
- % Match rate
- Detailed table with confidence scores

### Editable Data Grid

- Change product selections
- Adjust quantities
- Modify units
- Add/remove ingredients

### Real-time Preview

---

## 🔐 Security Considerations

### API Key Storage

- ✅ Uses environment variables (secure)
- ✅ Not stored in code
- ✅ Not saved to git
- ✅ User controls their own key

### Data Privacy

- ✅ Recipe prompts sent to Claude API
- ✅ Product database stays local
- ✅ No sensitive data transmitted
- ✅ Recipes saved locally

---

## 🚨 Known Limitations

### 1. Approximate Conversions

Some units are estimated:

- `dozen` (assumes 2 oz per egg)
- `bunch` (assumes 1 oz per bunch)
- `each` (varies by item)

**Solution**: Review and edit before saving.

### 2. Fuzzy Matching Threshold

- Set to 75% by default
- May miss some matches
- May match incorrectly if too low

**Solution**: Adjustable slider in UI (50-95%).

### 3. Claude API Costs

- ~$0.0015 per recipe
- Requires internet connection
- Rate limits apply (50 req/min)

**Solution**: Normal restaurant use won't hit limits.

### 4. Ingredient Not in Database

- If product doesn't exist, shows as unmapped
- Can't auto-cost without product

**Solution**: Add product to database first, or manually select substitute.

## 📞 Support

### If Something's Wrong

1. **Check API key**: `echo $env:ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`
2. **Check dependencies**: `pip list | grep -E "anthropic|rapidfuzz"`
3. **Check imports**: `python -c "import anthropic; import rapidfuzz; print('OK')"`
4. **Check linter**: No errors in `pages/6_AI_Recipe_Generator.py`

### Common Issues

**"ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'anthropic'"**
→ Run: `pip install -r requirements.txt`

**"API key not found"**
→ Set environment variable (see `setup_api_key.md`)

**"Low match rate (< 50%)"**
→ Lower match threshold slider or add more products to database

**"Recipe already exists"**
→ Change recipe name or delete old recipe in Recipe Builder
