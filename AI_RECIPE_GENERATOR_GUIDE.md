- ‚úÖ Cost calculations using your actual product prices
- ‚úÖ Full integration with existing Recipe Builder

## üöÄ Setup Instructions

### 1. Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

This installs:
- `anthropic>=0.39.0` - Claude API client
- `rapidfuzz>=3.0.0` - Fuzzy ingredient matching

### 2. Get Claude API Key

1. Visit [Anthropic Console](https://console.anthropic.com/settings/keys)
2. Sign up or log in
3. Create a new API key
4. Copy the key (starts with `sk-ant-...`)

### 3. Set Environment Variable

**Windows (PowerShell):**
```powershell
$env:ANTHROPIC_API_KEY='sk-ant-api03-your-key-here'
```

**Windows (Command Prompt):**
```cmd
set ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-api03-your-key-here
```

**Mac/Linux:**

## üìñ How It Works

### The Process

1. **Prompt** ‚Üí You describe the recipe in natural language
2. **Generate** ‚Üí Claude creates a structured recipe with ingredients in ounces
3. **Map** ‚Üí System fuzzy-matches ingredients to your product database
4. **Convert** ‚Üí Ounces are converted to each product's native unit (lb, gallon, etc.)
5. **Review** ‚Üí You can edit ingredients, quantities, and instructions
6. **Save** ‚Üí Recipe is saved in the same format as manually-created recipes

### Integration Flow

```
Your Prompt
    ‚Üì
Claude AI (JSON recipe)
    ‚Üì
Fuzzy Matching ‚Üí Your Product Database
    ‚Üì
Unit Conversion (oz ‚Üí lb/gallon/etc)
    ‚Üì
Format Conversion ‚Üí App Recipe Schema
    ‚Üì
save_recipe() from recipe_engine.py
    ‚Üì
data/recipes.json (same as Recipe Builder)
```

## üéØ Usage Examples

### Example 1: Simple Dish

**Prompt:**
```
Crispy buffalo chicken wings with blue cheese dressing.
Make 6 servings with 8 oz portions.
```

**Result:**
- Claude generates full recipe with measurements in oz
- Ingredients mapped to your products (e.g., "chicken wings" ‚Üí "Chicken Wings Fresh")
- Quantities converted (48 oz ‚Üí 3 lbs)
- Cost calculated using your product prices

### Example 2: Complex Recipe

**Prompt:**
```
Japanese karaage (fried chicken) with the following specs:
- Crispy coating using potato starch
- Soy-ginger marinade with sake and garlic
- Served with lemon wedges and scallion garnish
- 8 servings, 5 oz portions
- Include prep and cook times
```

**Result:**
- Detailed ingredient list with precise measurements
- Step-by-step cooking instructions
- All ingredients matched to your database
- Ready to save and use in inventory calculations

### Example 3: Prep Recipe

**Prompt:**
```
House ranch dressing for salad station.
Makes 1 gallon yield, uses buttermilk, mayo, herbs.
Should last 7 days refrigerated.
```

**Result:**
- Prep recipe format
- Shelf life noted in instructions
- Scaled for volume production

## üîß Features & Settings

### Match Confidence Slider (50-95%)

Controls how strict ingredient matching is:

- **50-70%**: Loose matching, more ingredients mapped (may have incorrect matches)
- **75-85%**: Balanced (recommended)
- **90-95%**: Strict matching, only very confident matches

**Tip:** Start at 75%. If too many ingredients are unmapped, lower to 65%.

### Ingredient Mapping Results

After generation, you'll see:
- ‚úÖ **Mapped**: Successfully matched to products
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Unmapped**: No match found (can edit manually)
- **Match Rate %**: Overall matching success

Click "View Mapping Details" to see:
- AI ingredient name
- Matched product name
- Match confidence score
- Original amount (oz)
- Converted amount (lb, gallon, etc.)

### Editing Before Save

You can edit:
- Recipe name, description, category
- Servings, prep time, cook time
- Individual ingredients (add/remove/change)
- Quantities and units
- Cooking instructions

Changes are **not auto-saved** until you click "üíæ Save Recipe".

## üß™ Unit Conversion Reference

The system automatically converts Claude's oz measurements:

| From (oz) | To Unit | Conversion |
|-----------|---------|------------|
| 16 oz | 1 lb | √∑ 16 |
| 128 oz | 1 gallon | √∑ 128 |
| 32 oz | 1 quart | √∑ 32 |
| 33.814 oz | 1 liter | √∑ 33.814 |
| 24 oz | 1 dozen (eggs) | √∑ 24 (approx) |
| 1 oz | 1 bunch (herbs) | 1:1 (approx) |

**Note:** Conversions for `dozen`, `bunch`, `each`, and `case` are estimates and should be reviewed before saving.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

### "Claude API key not found"
- Check environment variable is set: `echo $ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`
- Restart terminal/IDE after setting variable
- Verify key starts with `sk-ant-`

### "Claude didn't return valid JSON"
- API might be rate-limited (wait 1 minute)
- Prompt might be too vague (be more specific)
- Click "View AI Raw Output" to see what was returned

### Low Match Rate (<50%)
- Your product database may use different naming conventions
- Try lowering match confidence threshold
- Add products to database that match common ingredient names
- Edit ingredients manually after generation

### Ingredients in Wrong Units
- Check your `product_data.csv` has correct `Unit` column values
- Common units: `lb`, `gallon`, `quart`, `dozen`, `each`, `bunch`, `case`
- Manually edit unit in the ingredient editor before saving

### Recipe Already Exists Error
- Recipe names must be unique
- Either delete the old recipe (Recipe Builder ‚Üí Edit tab)
- Or change the new recipe name before saving

## üîí API Costs & Limits

### Claude API Pricing (as of 2025)
