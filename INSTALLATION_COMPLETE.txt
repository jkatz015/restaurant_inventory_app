   > export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY='sk-ant-your-key-here'

   (See setup_api_key.md for permanent setup)

4️⃣  RUN THE APP
   > streamlit run app.py

5️⃣  TEST THE FEATURE
   - Navigate to "AI Recipe Generator" in sidebar
   - Should see "✅ Claude API connected"
   - Enter a recipe prompt
   - Click "Generate Recipe with AI"
   - Review and save!

========================================
  KEY INTEGRATION FEATURES
========================================

✅ Uses your existing product database (data/product_data.csv)
✅ Saves to existing recipe file (data/recipes.json)
✅ Same format as Recipe Builder - 100% compatible
✅ Automatic ingredient mapping via fuzzy matching
✅ Smart unit conversion (oz → lb, gallon, etc.)
✅ Real cost calculations using your product prices
✅ No breaking changes to existing code
✅ Works with Recipe Builder, Variance Calc, etc.

========================================
  WHAT MAKES THIS "PROPERLY INTEGRATED"
========================================

❌ Did NOT create separate database
❌ Did NOT use different data format
❌ Did NOT require migration
❌ Did NOT break existing features
❌ Did NOT create parallel systems

✅ DID use your existing modules (recipe_engine.py)
✅ DID read from your product database
✅ DID save to your recipe file
✅ DID match your data schema
✅ DID maintain full compatibility

Result: AI recipes work seamlessly with all pages!

========================================
  EXAMPLE WORKFLOW
========================================

1. Prompt: "Buffalo chicken wings, 8 servings"
2. Claude generates recipe with ingredients in oz
3. System maps "chicken wings" → "Chicken Wings Fresh"
4. Converts 80 oz → 5 lb (your product unit)
5. Calculates cost using your prices
6. Shows mapping results (✅ 5/5 mapped, 100%)
7. You review and edit if needed
8. Save → Goes to recipes.json
9. Appears in Recipe Builder immediately

  API COSTS (Very Affordable!)
========================================

Claude Sonnet 4 Pricing:
  - ~$3 per 1 million tokens
  - 1 recipe = ~500 tokens = ~$0.0015
  - 1000 recipes = ~$1.50

Typical restaurant usage:
  - 10 recipes/month = $0.02/month
  - 100 recipes/month = $0.15/month
  - Heavy use = ~$1-5/month

========================================
  TESTING
========================================

Run unit tests:
  > pytest tests/test_ai_recipe_generator.py -v

Manual testing checklist:
  ☐ API key detected
  ☐ Recipe generation works
  ☐ Ingredients map correctly (>70% match rate)
  ☐ Units converted properly
  ☐ Costs calculated correctly
  ☐ Saved to recipes.json
  ☐ Appears in Recipe Builder
  ☐ Can edit like manual recipes

========================================
  TROUBLESHOOTING
========================================

"API key not found"
  → Set ANTHROPIC_API_KEY environment variable
  → Restart terminal after setting it

"ModuleNotFoundError: anthropic"
  → Run: pip install -r requirements.txt

"Low match rate (<50%)"
  → Lower match threshold slider in UI
  → Add more products to your database

"Recipe already exists"
  → Change recipe name or delete old recipe
